# Multiclass-Image-classication-on-UC-Merced-LandUse-Dataset-
This project aims at classification of remote sensing image dataset. â€¢ The model developed for classification is a fusion model of spatial features with dct features.3-layer fusion model of cnn is used with dct and lbp to improve the accuracy of prediction.
