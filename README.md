# Multiclass-Image-classication-on-UC-Merced-LandUse-Dataset-
This project aims at classification of remote sensing image dataset. â€¢ The model developed for classification is a fusion model of spatial features with dct features.3-layer fusion model of cnn is used with dct and lbp to improve the accuracy of prediction.

Ucmerced dataset is a 21 class land use image dataset meant for research purposes.

There are 100 images for each of the following classes:

agricultural

airplane

baseball

beach

buildings

chaparral

denseresidential

forest

freeway

golfcourse

This project is a research projects which contains various features extraction techniques like spatial level features and temporal features. This features are fused together,tested together as well independently.

Various accuracy enchancing techniques like augmentation and feature level fusion of dct and lbp are used Project contains various ipynb notebooks tried on the dataset.
